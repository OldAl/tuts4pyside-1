Tuts for PySide
===============

Thank You!
==========

Thanks to all the developers of PySide, who shared their work and expertise
in the PySide system and examples. Particularly thank you for your forbearance 
and patience when sharing your expertise with the less experienced PySide users. 

I am particularly grateful to Aaron Richiger, who made many valuable suggestions 
and introduced me to github. Learning is easy when expert help is at hand!

PySide Newbie Tutorials
=======================

The following are small examples for real newbies:

::
    
    about box    - shows about box with os information.
    show licence - reads and displays licence information.
    quit prog    - provides additional button to close program.
    combine bits - combines all of the above into a coherent small program

The following is an example that shows how a Python code can be developed
separately from its GUI.

::
    
    truss        - solves statically determinate trusses, a gui example for 
    an almost real type of problems.
