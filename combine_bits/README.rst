README
==========

This text is written in the reStructuredText format. To change it to a neat 
pdf output, execute the following command in a CLI window::

    rst2pdf  README

If rst2pcf is not installed, you can install it by the following command::

    sudo apt-get install rst2pdf

You should find that README.pdf is easier to read than plain text, 
including the reStructuredText.

Sequence
===========

It is recommended to run the programs in the following sequence::

    combine-STAGE1.py
    combine.py
    combine_allin1.py
    combine_alter.py

If you quit any time after running combine.py, you will have completed the 
main part of this tutorial.The following two "combine" scripts show often 
used alternative strategies of composing main programs.  More detailed 
descriptions follow.
